What is devops ?
Software development lyfe cycle to automate the devops and to release the application.
Development team(planning coding build testing) Operation team(Release Deployment operate monitrate)

What is application?
It is a software. 
Application is a combination of service which is used by the user.
Git full form ?
Global information(means source code) we can tracker

version control system (or) source code management 
vcs meaning: it will store each version code is seperately

                  What is git ?
Git is a distrubuted version control system
git is used to we can track the multipul files
it will maintain multiple version of the same file.
it is platform independent and it is free opensource
They can handle large projects of efficently
its written on c Program
its came on 2005

platform independent(means you can install windows or macos or linux it will work)

443 status code(in a file system particular part is damage so we willget the 443)

                 Git archicture ?
Working Directory: where we write the source code 
Staging area:  where we track the source code
Reporsitory: where we store trackd code

Creating a workig directory
mkdir college  
cd college/
yum install git -y    (yum pkg we need to install git -y yes)
git init
ll -a
Note: Without .git we cant run any commands of git
We can crate a file and  we can track file and we can save the file

touch file1                      To create a file
git status 
git add file1                    To track file
git status                       To check the status of file
git commit -m "ver-1" file       To save file

How many files are commited to give the list (git log).
git log
I want out put single line.
git log --oneline
last two lines
git --oneline -2
                     
           //.git means these is local repo//
Each developer will write the source code we need to push the github


git branch  To see the branch
if we want to see the branch we need to inital commit then only we see.
We need to create the appplication  so we can index.html
vim index.html   
git add index.html
git status
git commit -m "abc" index.html
git branch           Now we can see the branch

How to crate a branch
git branch apple
git checkout apple
touch apple{1..5}    Now we have working directory
git add movies*      Now we have tracked
git commmit -m "dev-1" apples*   Now we have committed

git checkout -b banana   branch is created then go to the branch
touch banana{1..5}
git add banana*
git commit -m "dev-3" banana*

How to connect github to git 
we can use these command git remote add orgin https://github.com/obul2251/paytm.git
ll -a  local.git to paytm.git connect.

                    (Now we can push the code) 
git checkout master
git push origin master
username:obul2251
passwd:
How to create a token go to settings developersettings Personalaccestoken tokensclassic
Generate new token  generate new token classic TOkenName:Paytm first 6 select then generate token

we have to delete local on source we nedd to get github
 
cd
ll
rm -rf paytm/
ll
git clone paste link
ll     paytm is available
cd paytm/
ll       index.html is having
git checkout movies
ll
git chechout apple
ll

                    //Git Merge// git rebase//

We have to merge the one branch to another branch files.
git checkout master
git merge movies
git merge obul
git merge dth
git merge samsung
git rebase reddy

                      //How to merge the github//
 pullrequest  newpullrequest  createpullrequest againpullrequest  mergepullrequest
 conform merge  Done

                     //How to revert the files//
How to merging one branch files to  another branch files to backup we can use the revert
git checkout master
git revert recharge
ll
git revert obul
ll
git revert dth
git revert reddy

                   // Git clone//
Git clone is used to download the github repository to local.
The repo must be public.

                  // Git fork // 
How to download the one repository to another r epository.
How to download the repository from github to github so we can use fork.
The repo must be public.

                  //Git Push//
we have to push the code local repo to github repo.

                  // git pull// 
we have to pull the code gubhub to local repo.
we have to change the github it will reflect the git
git pull origin master

                  //Git fetch
To show the changes github to git but it will not visible. 
git fetch origin master.

                 //How to delete the branches?//

git branch -D train  
Current branch we cant the delete.
How to back up the branch ?
git pull origin tarin            To restore the branch
git checkout  train
ll
git branch
                  //How to rename the brach?//
git branch -m train obul
git branch
git branch -m obul train

                  //Merge(means add)conflict  //
when we can merge 2 differents branches with same file and different code conflicts will occur
How to reslove: To resolve Manually.

If we have comitted how many file are attached it will  (git show)
git show  id paste  

                    //Git cherry pick//
it will merge the specific files from one branch to anotherbranch.
we can use committed id
git log --oneline
git cherry-pick (java-id paste)


                      //Git Stash//
it will hide the files temperorly
it will applicable for tracked files   
Some files are work is not comple so we cantemparory hide these file.
touch php
git add php
git status      php files work is not compele
git stash
ll              file is not showing

How to backup the stash file.
git stash list            To show the list
git stash apply            
git stash clear           To delete all stash
git stash pop             pop is delete last stash


                      //Tags//

git tag
git tag -i list
git tag -a v1.10 -m "ver" tags"
git tag -l

                            //Jenkins//
its a ci/cd tool
CI: Jenkins is continous integration (integration means adding) Contineous build + contineoustest 
old code to new code. 

Before ci: time waste manual work regular mistakes
After ci: Time save automated work  bugs find more quickly

CD: Cintineous Delivery/Contineous Deployment
Contineous Delivery: Applicatio Manual deployment to production
Contineous Deployment: Application to automation deployment to production
Deployment: Process off installing the application to App server.  


ENV  Or Evn is nothing but Servers
DEV: De velopers
QA: Testers
UAT: Client  
PROD: USers

ENV are two types:
Pre-prod/Non-prod: DEV QAT UAT
Live env  Prod: users

Jenkins is a free and opensource and ci tool.
its written on java language.
Jenkins is platform independent.
Jenkins it will automate the ci and cd and Deployment.
Jenkins it will automate the entire sdlc.
it will have plegins to work and to automate.

                 // How to work in jenkins?//
      If you want to work in jenkins we need to create job.

How to create a job?
new item -- > name -- > free style -- > ok -- > Build Steps -- > execute shell
we can run linux coomands on execute shell.

Global variable: These variable will work on outsie job.
Dashboard Managejenkins  Systems Global,properties Env variable click

Jenkins enroirment variables:
These variables will be given by jenkins.
User cant define jenkins variables.

WHEN WE CAN STOP AND START THE SERVER BY DEFAULT ALL SERVICES WILL BE ON STOPPED STATE.

                          //Cron job//

Cronjob is used to shedule the work in jenkins.
EX; Deployment automation Data base backup automation Build automation

Biuld trigger ()build periodically   shedule 12 10 22 6 5  save Automarically build is shedue.
Limitation: We cant check the source 

                          //Pollscm//
Pollscm is used to it  will trigger the buid when code is changed in given time
pollscm  shedule 10 15 4 6 9 save then go to change the source code it will automaticall build is trigger
LIMITATION:
llam shedule but developer we can change the code 6am  (time waste)
11am  i can change 5 time cobe but it will trigger only 5th build (builds waste)


                          //WEBHOOK//
WHEN WE CAN CHANGE THE CODE THEN AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER THE BUILD(EVERY TIME)
 
GITHUB HOOK TRIGGER FOR GITSCM POLLING (ENABLE) SAVE.

Pipeline Advantage:
it is used to automate the work.
it is used to save time.

Pileline are two types?
1) Scripted pipeline
2) Declarative pipeline (Highly used)

Declarative Pipeline:
its a pipeline used to divide the work into stages and steps.
each stage will have one or more than on step.
we use groovy syntax for pipeline.
we can use pipeline for creating ci cd process.
we can integrate all tools with pipeline.


 Pipeline:
pipeline {
    agent any   which worker node you  are executing (master and slave )
                Which server you sre executing //ey worker node execute chesthunav
    stages { 
        stage('one') {
            steps {
                sh 'touch file1'
cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/pipeline

CI PIPELINE: build + test


pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/devopsbyraham/jenkins-java-project.git'
            }
        }
        stage('compile') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }
        stage('test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('artifact') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
          }
    }
}


                    //Master and slave//
I have three jobs contineous build it will get load then server is crashed.

                  //MASTER AND SLAVE//
when we continously build jobs on jenkins ,it will get load and have the chance to crash.
to avoid this load on jenkins we use salve servers to build the jobs

slaves are our ec2-servers
jenkins slaves are used to build the jobs
master will commnicate with salve using ssh.
here on slave agent should be installed (java-11)
without java-11 our slaves will not work.
slaves are platform independent.
label: way of assigning work to particular slave.
